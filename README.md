# Study Amigo
A flashcard app for learning basic Spanish vocabulary using a spaced repitition technique.

The better the user knows a word, the less often the word will appear. This allows the user to study more effectively, and progress is saved as you go.

Runs on Node JS and uses a restful API. Supports both account creation and Google authentication. All vocabulary is voiced using Google's Text-to-Speech API.
